# Introduction
The Raito Command-Line Interface (CLI) has two main purposes:

1. Used in continuous integration (CI) pipelines to easily and immediately apply access controls to the target data source(s) right from your source code repository. It enables an easy to use access-as-code (GitOps) mechanism for (data) engineers to locally manage the access controls for the data objects. For this, you can use the *access* command.

1. Used as an edge component to synchronize data between your data sources and identity stores, and Raito Cloud. For this, you can use the *run* command.

Basically, the run command will execute a list of actions on each of the targets:
    1. Fetch all users and groups from the identity store targets (e.g. Okta, Active Directory, ...) and synchronize this with the matching identity store in Raito Cloud. Note that a data source can also be an identity store when it manages its own users & groups (e.g. Snowflake).<br>

    1. Fetch all the meta data from data sources (which can be done through a data catalog) and update the appropriate data source in Raito Cloud.<br>
    *Step 3 and 4 in the picture*<br><br>
    1. Fetch the access permissions set in the data sources and push that to the Raito Cloud. This will only look at the access permissions that are not set by Raito (see next step). This way a full 360Â° of all access controls is available in Raito Cloud.<br>
    *Step 5 and 6 in the picture*<br><br>
    1. Get the access controls from Raito Cloud (calculated from the data policies and manual grants) and update the target data sources accordingly.<br>
    *Step 7 and 8 in the picture*<br><br>
    1. Retrieve the data usage information from the data sources and push that data to Raito Cloud.<br>
    *Step 9 and 10 in the picture*<br><br>

## Target
Targets are the different data sources, identity stores, data catalogs, ... that the CLI will connect with. The logic to interact with the different types of targets is implemented in plugins (also called connectors).
 
See [Target Configuration](/docs/cli/configuration#targets) on how to specify the targets in the CLI.

## Connector
A [connector](/docs/cli/connectors) is the part of the CLI that connects to a specific target.

For example, the [*Snowflake* connector](/docs/cli/connectors/snowflake) is used to connect to Snowflake targets.

Connectors are implemented as plugins for the CLI. A connector plugin is basically a small application, implementing a specific API to make sure the CLI can communicate with it to execute the necessary target-specific work (e.g. fetch the Snowflake meta data or push the access controls to Snowflake).
