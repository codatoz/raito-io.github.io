# Overview
Raito provides a powerful and flexible abstraction layer to monitor and manage access controls across many different systems. 
While the main focus is currently on data warehouses, this can easily be applied to any system where access for users needs to be managed. 

First, we'll explain some [Core Concepts](/docs/overview/concepts) which are essential to understand when using Raito.  
Then, we'll dive deeper into the [Raito Architecture](/docs/overview/architecture) to explain how data flows in and out of Raito.

When you understand these, you are ready to set up your first data source to start leveraging the power of Raito. You can easily follow one of the [guides](/docs/guide) to get started with this.
