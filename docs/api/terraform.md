# Terraform

In order to allow you to manage Raito resources through Terraform, we also provide a Terraform plugin.

The following resources are currently available, so you can fetch, create, update and delete them from Terraform:
- Data Sources
- Identity Stores
- Access Controls
  - Grants
  - Purposes
  - Masks
  - Filters
- Users

All documentation to use the Raito Terraform Provider can be found on [https://registry.terraform.io/providers/raito-io/raito/latest/docs](https://registry.terraform.io/providers/raito-io/raito/latest/docs){:target="_blank"}.
