# API Integrations

To easily automate certain processes in Raito Cloud or to integrate it with other tools, multiple API tools are provided:
 - A low-level [GraphQL API](/docs/api/graphql)
 - An [SDK for Go](/docs/api/sdk)
 - A [Terraform plugin](/docs/api/terraform)
 - A [Dbt integration](/docs/cli/connectors/dbt), available as a connector for the [Raito CLI](/docs/cli)
