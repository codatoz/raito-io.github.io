# Access Control Issues

Different kind of problems can occur with Access Controls. These issues are listed on the `Issues` tab on the Access Control page. When there are issues that require your attention, the issue count will be shown in red on the tab. 

Currently, the only type of issue available is shown when some went wrong during the synchronization of the access control. The synchronization status of the access control will also be `Failed` in this case.
