# Request access to data

Raito enables collaboration in data access management. This starts from the request to access data. Every user, regardless of its role in Raito, can request access to data. An access request is initiated by clicking the button “Request access” on the dashboard.

Requesting access to data can be done in 5 easy steps:

## The type of request

To start a request, you need to select which type of request you want to raise. It is up to your Raito admin to determine which types of requests can be raised. Possible types of requests are:

- **Access to an access provider**: you know to which access provider(s) you want to be added
- **Access to a data object:** you know to which data object(s) you want to obtain access to

## Why

Here, you should explain the reason why you require access to the data. This is important for the data owners to be able to make an informed decision about the approval and implementation of your request.

## What

Now you will be selecting what data you want access to. Depending on the type of request, this step will be slightly different:

- **Access to an access provider**: select 1 or more access providers
- **Access to a data object:** select 1 or more data objects and define the permissions you want to obtain.

## Who

Next, you have to select who you are requesting access for. By default, Raito pre-selects your name. You can however raise a request on behalf of anyone and you can even remove yourself from this who-list.

## Review

Before your access request is sent to the next stage in the process, you are presented with a final overview of your request so you can do a final review.
