# Assign data owners

A data owner of a data object, is the person responsible to manage access to the data. Raito allows multiple data owners for a single data object. Furthermore data ownership is propagated downwards in the data object tree. This means that whenever you own a schema, you also own all tables within that schema.

Ownership can be assigned at every level of the data object tree. As an admin, or an owner of the object, you see three dots next to the data object name. This menu allows you to edit data owners. You can add or remove data owners. 
This also allows you to delegate your data ownership responsibilities.
