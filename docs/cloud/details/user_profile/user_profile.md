# User Profile
## User Preferences
As a user in Raito, you have some preferences that you can adapt to tailor Raito to your needs. To get to your preferences, click on your user avatar on the top right of the page and choose `Preferences` from the menu that pops up.

Here, you'll have a few things you can do, including:
 - Updating your password.
 - Configuring your notification preferences.
 - Temporarily delegating your ownership to somebody else.
 - Integrating your Raito account with Slack (coming soon).

We'll discuss some of these options more in detail below.

### Notifications
To indicate your preferences on how you want to receive notifications from Raito, on your Preferences page, click on the `Notifications` entry.

You'll be presented with the different categories of notifications that are sent by Raito. For each category, you can configure how you want to receive these notifications.  
You can do this by clicking the button on the right of the each category and selecting the notification destinations that you want to enable.

Note that notifications will always be visible in the Notifications panel in the Raito application, which can be found by clicking the bell-icon on the top right of the page, next to your user avatar.

### Ownership Delegation
Going on a well deserved holiday or will you not be available to respond to incoming access requests for another reason? No worries! You can temporarily delegate your data ownership duties to somebody else.  
During this time, access requests that would normally be assigned to you, will now get assigned to your colleague so that you don't get bothered.

To do this, click on the `Delegate` entry on your Preferences page. Here, you'll have the possibility to enable and disable the delegation. When you enable the delegation, you will be asked to pick the user you want to delegate your ownership to and the time period during which you want this delegation to be active.

The user you are delegating the ownership to, will receive a notification when 
 - you set up the delegation
 - you update the delegation time period
 - you remove the delegation while it's not expired yet
 - the delegation period starts

During the period that the delegation is active, an information box will indicate this on your profile page and the profile page of the person you delegated to.
